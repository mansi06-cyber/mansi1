class Solution:
    def totalFine(self, date, car, fine):
        total = 0
        l = len(car)
        for i in range(l):
            if (date % 2 == 0 and car[i] % 2 != 0) or (date % 2 != 0 and car[i] % 2 == 0):
                total += fine[i]
        return total  # this is now correctly inside the function
output
Input: date = 8, car[] = [2222, 2223, 2224], fine[] = [200, 300, 400]
Output: 300
